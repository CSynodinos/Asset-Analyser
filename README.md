The aim of this project is to analyze stock and cryptocurrency data before COVID and during COVID using multiple machine learning models. The resulting analysis will look at how market volatility has been affected by the pandemic in both markets and how that volatility can affect price predictions. 

So far in the project, the libraries for stock data extraction, data storage, data handling, data preprocessing and model creation have been created, as well as a Jupyter notebook that acts as the main file which downloads the data, stores them in an SQLite database, adds them in dataframes through the use of queries and creates models that predict the Apple and Microsoft stock prices for the next day after today's date. Next step is to finish for all stocks and do the same procedure for the same stocks but for dates preceding the COVID pandemic. Finally, the same procedure needs to be done for cryptocurrencies.
